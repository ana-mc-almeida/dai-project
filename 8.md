# Task 8 <!-- omit in toc -->

Use Pentaho Server and Saiku Analytics to perform an analysis on the data cube. In particular, analyze the energy consumption by region (i.e., ‘district’) and year, but only for years with complete data from January to December. 
**For each region**, check the following:

- [A: The desired increase/decrease for each district, and the analysis of the impact of smart meters;](#a-the-desired-increasedecrease-for-each-district-and-the-analysis-of-the-impact-of-smart-meters)
  - [Consumption](#consumption)
  - [Percentage of smart meters](#percentage-of-smart-meters)
    - [All years](#all-years)
- [B: The influence of the seasonality on consumption;](#b-the-influence-of-the-seasonality-on-consumption)
- [C: The impact of smart meters on consumption.](#c-the-impact-of-smart-meters-on-consumption)
  - [By District](#by-district)
    - [Normalized](#normalized)
    - [Not Normalized](#not-normalized)
  - [By Month](#by-month)
    - [Normalized](#normalized-1)
    - [Not Normalized](#not-normalized-1)


## A: The desired increase/decrease for each district, and the analysis of the impact of smart meters;

Has the consumption and the percentage of smart meters increased or decreased from one year to the next?
